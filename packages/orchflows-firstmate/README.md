# Orchflows FirstMate

A standalone Orchflows variant for **FirstMate running in Herdr only**, with Claude Code and Codex CLI as worker harnesses. This development release supplies a thin client for legacy single read-only Work/Review and an explicitly admitted bounded Linux dynamic workflow. **Execution requires the actual controller and an exact retained task attachment.** An explicitly selected ordinary ship/local-only root can deliver committed output through FirstMate. [Bounded leaf authoring](skills/orch-build-workflow/SKILL.md) can create and trial a complete non-delegating workflow/guidance library in that profile. General composing Build, SelfImprove, nesting and other ship modes remain blocked. The upstream library is preserved for migration.

The target keeps Work, independent Review, dynamic composition, workflow authoring, self-improvement, layered guidance, model/effort choices, example libraries and history inspection. Its fundamental change is execution ownership: a root crewmate composes work, while FirstMate creates and controls component tasks through a task-group contract and owns all Herdr endpoints. [Execution gate and architecture](docs/architecture.md#firstmate-execution-gate).

Source refresh `0.1.0-dev.3` retains upstream `ca72258493480ddcfe73b3f01d0475ad532e4726`. The added experimental `design-loop` example is inactive migration source; it is not enabled, installed by default or used by this refresh. Version `0.1.0-dev.4` adds the explicitly admitted Linux Review primitive; each attachment still admits only one read-only component.

Version `0.1.0-dev.5` adds a launch-bound client context. The matching FirstMate distribution can enable a package and selected custom libraries once for a local project; ordinary scout spawn and relaunch supply the retained skills and client context. Custom workflows remain limited to one admitted read-only Work or Review. Dynamic composition and writers remain gated.

Version `0.1.0-dev.6` adds explicit per-request Work/Review and writable choices for a dynamic attachment. A normal Linux root scout can compose up to 32 components, gather writer commits, join an exact candidate with ordinary Git, request one fresh Review and make one repair/check pass. Selected custom workflows reuse those primitives. FirstMate owns worktrees, communication, recovery and delivery. See the [client contract](docs/firstmate-client.md) for the exact profile and remaining gates.

Version `0.1.0-dev.8` adds explicit dynamic ship/local-only selection. The retained attachment binds root kind, mode and `fm/<id>` branch; package and controller negotiate `ship-local-only` capability. Components remain scouts returning to the parent. The root follows ordinary committed ready-branch delivery, and FirstMate's existing local merge owner refuses unfinished composition. New default ship tasks and retained scout clients keep their existing contracts.

Bounded authoring uses ordinary Work for the complete library and a fresh leaf trial, then commits the trial output and findings before the one exact-candidate Review. Relaunch recovers those same requests and requirements. The [client contract](docs/firstmate-client.md#bounded-leaf-authoring) distinguishes this case from portable or nested Build; FirstMate retains enablement, launch and local delivery ownership.

## Prepare package files

Requires Python 3.11+. From this package checkout:

```sh
python scripts/orchflows.py setup --home <dedicated-package-home>
python scripts/orchflows.py doctor --home <dedicated-package-home>
python scripts/orchflows.py resolve orchflows-firstmate --home <dedicated-package-home> --skill orch-work
```

Omit `--home` to use `ORCHFLOWS_FIRSTMATE_HOME` or `~/.orchflows-firstmate`. Setup prepares a complete core, Python runtime and separate catalogs; it leaves host settings untouched by default. It does not install a FirstMate adapter, register host plugins, start workers or establish live compatibility. `status: ready` means package checks passed, accompanied by `readiness_scope: package-only` and `integration.execution_ready: false`. [Home behavior](docs/home.md).

The resolver accepts `orchflows` as a compatibility alias **only for this fork's installed core**. Catalogs publish `orchflows-firstmate`; native `orchflows:*` skill names do not become aliases. The normal Orchflows home and catalogs are protected. Existing library references still need migration before use.

## What is preserved

- Work and independent Review remain the two conceptual primitives. The experimental [client](docs/firstmate-client.md) admits legacy Work/Review and bounded Linux dynamic composition with writer results; broader workflow parity remains unverified.
- Guidance selection, dotted specializations and assignment-specific model/effort preferences retain their upstream contracts.
- Setup, library copying, package resolution, filesystem doctor and native transcript inspection remain available as package tools.
- All example libraries, assets, tests, reports and licenses are retained from the pinned source. They are migration fixtures, not certified FirstMate workflows. `setup --example NAME` copies their original bytes and does not adapt their native dispatch, install commands or dependency resolution.

See [provenance and deliberate changes](UPSTREAM.md), [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [worker harnesses](docs/hosts.md), [home](docs/home.md) and [history limits](docs/history.md). This package has its own version and release line; it does not update the normal Orchflows checkout or installed core.

## Upstream migration baseline (inactive)

The quoted original README below preserves the feature descriptions and source links at the pinned upstream revision. Its installation commands, native-child execution instructions and compatibility claims are historical source material. Do not run them as this fork's instructions; the execution gate above controls this package.

>
> **Delete your skill libraries. You only need two skills.**
>
> Compose these skills into infinitely complex, task-specific workflows, including self-improving loops.
>
> [**Work**](skills/orch-work/SKILL.md) makes a result. [**Review**](skills/orch-review/SKILL.md) independently judges it. Everything else is composition.
>
> ## Why
>
> Skill libraries keep growing around a model's current limitations. [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack#the-sprint) packages a prescribed engineering sprint and specialist roles. [Matt Pocock's skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills#why-these-skills-exist) encode practices such as grilling sessions, test-first development and debugging gates. [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers#the-basic-workflow) specifies a mandatory development process, down to task size and review stages.
>
> Our objection is overprescription. Too much of the agent's judgment has already been made for it: how to investigate, how small to divide the work, when to stop and ask, which sequence to follow. That makes a workflow inflexible and its execution less adaptive to the task. These libraries offer customization, and some already separate model overrides; the problem is how much procedure remains embedded in the skills themselves.
>
> Overprescription also ages badly. A workaround for one model can become unnecessary ceremony for the next. A model that can now reason through a whole change still gets marched through steps written for one that could not. When those corrections are scattered across skills, every model release invites another round of workflow rewrites.
>
> **Orchflows abstracts prescription into guidance and guidance extension documents.** The two skills handle making and reviewing. Workflows describe the relationships between those operations. Separate, modular documents hold domain preferences, task specializations and corrections for model weaknesses.
>
> When a new model no longer needs a correction, delete it from the guidance or extension document. Keep the preferences you still care about. The two skills and your workflow structures stay unchanged across model upgrades; model-related churn belongs in these modular guidance documents.
>
> ## Install
>
> Requires Python 3.11+ and Codex or Claude Code with native subagents.
>
> ```sh
> git clone https://github.com/DanMcInerney/orchflows.git
> cd orchflows
> python scripts/orchflows.py setup
> ```
>
> Run the two commands for your host:
>
> ```sh
> # Codex
> codex plugin marketplace add ~/.orchflows
> codex plugin add orchflows@orchflows-home
>
> # Claude Code
> claude plugin marketplace add ~/.orchflows
> claude plugin install orchflows@orchflows-home --scope user
> ```
>
> Start a new session. [Setup options](docs/home.md#setup) · [Host registration and invocation](docs/hosts.md#register-and-refresh).
>
> ## Usage
>
> Describe the task. If you do not supply a workflow, Orchflows prefers a specific match when one fits; otherwise [/orch-dynamic-workflow](skills/orch-dynamic-workflow/SKILL.md) composes the smallest useful workflow for the task.
>
> **Simple task.** The coordinator makes and verifies an already-clear change directly. One independent child reviews it. This is the smallest dynamic workflow, shown with no repairs needed:
>
> ```mermaid
> flowchart LR
>     W["Coordinator<br/>Make and verify"] --> R["orch-review<br/>Independent review"]
>     R --> D([Deliver])
>     classDef work fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b,stroke-width:2px;
>     classDef review fill:#f5f3ff,stroke:#8b5cf6,color:#4c1d95,stroke-width:2px;
>     classDef result fill:#f8fafc,stroke:#94a3b8,color:#0f172a;
>     class W work;
>     class R review;
>     class D result;
> ```
>
> **Larger task.** Independent workers run in parallel, their results join, and one reviewer assesses the combined work. When fixes are needed, an existing or new worker can implement them:
>
> ```mermaid
> flowchart TD
>     T([Task]) --> A["orch-work<br/>Worker A"]
>     T --> B["orch-work<br/>Worker B"]
>     T --> C["orch-work<br/>Worker C"]
>     A --> J[Join and verify]
>     B --> J
>     C --> J
>     J --> R["orch-review<br/>Review joined result"]
>     R -->|Fixes needed| F["Worker<br/>Implement fixes"]
>     R -->|No fixes| D([Verify and deliver])
>     F --> D
>     classDef work fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b,stroke-width:2px;
>     classDef review fill:#f5f3ff,stroke:#8b5cf6,color:#4c1d95,stroke-width:2px;
>     classDef coordinate fill:#eff6ff,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#1e3a8a;
>     classDef result fill:#f8fafc,stroke:#94a3b8,color:#0f172a;
>     class A,B,C,F work;
>     class R review;
>     class J coordinate;
>     class T,D result;
> ```
>
> There is one repair pass with verification, without another review. The coordinator can also make clear fixes directly. Calling `orch-work` alone creates just one worker; the dynamic workflow includes independent review.
>
> **Custom workflows.** Use [/orch-build-workflow](skills/orch-build-workflow/SKILL.md) to turn a recurring task into a reusable workflow. It drafts the composition, tries it on real work, and refines it before independent review:
>
> ```mermaid
> flowchart LR
>     A([Recurring task]) --> W[Draft workflow]
>     W --> T[Run a real trial]
>     T -->|Refine| W
>     T -->|Ready| R[Independent review]
>     R --> D([Fix, verify and save])
>     classDef work fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b,stroke-width:2px;
>     classDef review fill:#f5f3ff,stroke:#8b5cf6,color:#4c1d95,stroke-width:2px;
>     classDef coordinate fill:#eff6ff,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#1e3a8a;
>     classDef result fill:#f8fafc,stroke:#94a3b8,color:#0f172a;
>     class W work;
>     class R review;
>     class T coordinate;
>     class A,D result;
> ```
>
> [Register the saved library with your host](docs/hosts.md#register-and-refresh) to invoke its workflows by name.
>
> **Models and effort.** Give Work and Review optional defaults, then override any named assignment—even the final fixer:
>
> > Work: gpt-5.6-sol at medium. Review: gpt-6-astra at high. Worker B: high. Final fixer: gpt-6-astra at xhigh.
>
> Use models and effort levels supported by your host. This works for dynamic and saved workflows. To save these preferences, ask `/orch-build-workflow` to keep them beside the assignments in `SKILL.md`. Your current request overrides saved preferences field by field; settings absent from both use native defaults. A worker with different settings runs separately when the host cannot change an existing agent. [Resolution and host controls](docs/architecture.md#model-and-effort).
>
> ## Design
>
> ### Start with work and independent judgment
>
> Give an agent a result to produce, then give another agent the result to assess. Keep the assignment specific and let the model choose how to do the work. Add instructions where you have a deliberate preference or an observed failure to correct.
>
> | Skill | Contract |
> | --- | --- |
> | [orch-work](skills/orch-work/SKILL.md) | A fresh native child makes the requested result under selected **Make** guidance. |
> | [orch-review](skills/orch-review/SKILL.md) | A fresh child who did not make the result assesses it under selected **Review** guidance, without fixing it. |
>
> A reviewer can inspect code, judge a film, rank evidence or compare competing designs. The subject changes; the two operations do not.
>
> ### Compose the task
>
> A workflow is a `SKILL.md` that connects these operations: what can run in parallel, what depends on what, what gets reviewed, and whether the result feeds another round. It supplies assignments, context and outputs. The same primitives support a single review, a research team, a production pipeline or an improvement loop.
>
> The package includes three ready-made compositions: [dynamic work](skills/orch-dynamic-workflow/SKILL.md), [workflow building](skills/orch-build-workflow/SKILL.md) and [self-improvement from agent history](skills/orch-self-improve/SKILL.md). They compose the two primitives and show how to write your own. A workflow declares its agent count and any repetition; loops are part of the requested workflow.
>
> Codex or Claude Code runs the agents. Orchflows adds no agent runtime, scheduler or workflow language. Loading a workflow applies its instructions in the current context; calling a primitive launches a child.
>
> ### Supply guidance separately
>
> Guidance describes what good work means in a domain. Each document has a **Make** section for production and a **Review** section for assessment. For example, code guidance can require independently runnable tests; visual guidance can require inspection of the rendered result.
>
> Select only the domains the task needs. A film might use `writing`, `visual-design` and `short-video`. A coding task might use `code` and `code.api`. The workflow's structure stays the same when its selected guidance changes.
>
> ### Extend only the differences
>
> Guidance extension documents specialize a domain. `code.api.md` extends `code.md`; `short-video.marketing.md` adds marketing preferences to `short-video.md`. A brand can add `short-video.marketing.<brand>.md`. Each extension states what it adds or changes, without copying its parents.
>
> Your libraries can also extend an existing domain with a `guidance/code.md` of their own. Keep corrections for a particular model separately removable in such a library. When the correction stops helping, remove the instruction or deselect that library. Model names do not become new domain names.
>
> The outer workflow resolves guidance once, from general to specific. At each level it reads core guidance, then selected libraries in the supplied order. More specific guidance takes precedence within its domain; independent domains combine. Resolved paths and request context pass through to the workers and reviewers. See [guidance selection](docs/architecture.md#guidance-selection) for the complete contract.
>
> ## Example workflows
>
> These examples show parallel collection, creative production and improvement using the same two skills. Social search, Short video, Evolve and Design loop are optional libraries: add one with `python scripts/orchflows.py setup --example <name>`, then [install it through your host](docs/hosts.md#register-and-refresh). Each library documents its tool dependencies. Self-improve is included in the core installation.
>
> ### Social search
>
> > Research how developers are using coding agents. Search GitHub, Hacker News and Reddit, then rank the strongest evidence.
>
> [Social search](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/orchflows/tree/main/example-workflows/social-search) tackles the same kind of research as [last30days](https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill), which bundles source integrations, parallel search and engagement scoring into a dedicated research engine. Social search builds collection and independent assessment from smaller, reusable workflows. Your prompt sets the sources, dates and bounds.
>
> **Each source search is itself a workflow.** The reusable `search-site` workflow composes `orch-work`, source guidance and an evidence handoff. It can run alone or become one branch of `social-search`. The current library supplies guidance for **Reddit, Hacker News, GitHub, X, YouTube, Lemmy, web search, and RSS/Atom feeds**; other accessible sources use general guidance. These are instances of the same workflow with different guidance.
>
> `social-search` composes the selected searches in parallel, gathers their evidence and gaps, then calls the separate `rank-evidence` workflow, which composes `orch-review`:
>
> ```mermaid
> flowchart TD
>     Q(["social-search<br/>Question and source scope"]) --> G["search-site<br/>GitHub"]
>     Q --> H["search-site<br/>Hacker News"]

>     class G,H,R,S work;
>     class J review;
>     class E coordinate;
>     class Q,O result;
> ```
>
> N collection assignments use N workers and one reviewer. Shared original sources have one owner; missing or failed collection stays visible as a gap. Source-specific guidance shapes collection; shared research and writing guidance shapes the final assessment.
>
> ### Short video
>
> > Make a 30-second launch film for this product. Deliver the editable project and the finished video.
>
> [Short video](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/orchflows/tree/main/example-workflows/short-video) gives one maker the brief, then sends the actual rendered exports to a fresh reviewer. Genre, placement and brand requirements come from the brief and selected guidance.
>
> ```mermaid
> flowchart LR
>     B([Brief and selected guidance]) --> M["orch-work<br/>Make film"]
>     M --> E[Editable project and exports]
>     E --> R["orch-review<br/>Inspect exports"]
>     R --> D([Deliver film, source and findings])
>     classDef work fill:#ecfdf5,stroke:#059669,color:#064e3b,stroke-width:2px;

>     class M work;
>     class R review;
>     class B,E,D result;
> ```
>
> One film uses one maker and one reviewer, including its placement versions. Additional films can run in parallel. The composition ends after review; a repair round is a separate requested step.
>
> ### Evolve
>
> > Improve this game's performance for an hour while preserving gameplay. Also improve how you search for optimizations.
>
> [Evolve](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/orchflows/tree/main/example-workflows/evolve) starts with an artifact or creation brief. It designs an evaluation when none is supplied, makes a challenger, independently compares it with the current best, and retains only confirmed improvements. Every experiment saves evidence and a checkpoint.

>     class S,O result;
> ```
>
> The working **harness** is the maker instructions, tools and search strategy used by the run. Evolve can test a change to that harness against its predecessor, then use the verified revision in later rounds. Its coordinating evaluation and promotion rules stay fixed during that comparison. Harness experiments use one proposer and two fresh makers per test case, with independent review of their outputs. A subjective winner requires confirmation from a second fresh reviewer.
>
> The default is three rounds with one challenger per round. A continuous request removes the round cap; the host must keep executing or resume the checkpoint. A plateau changes the search strategy. It does not prove the artifact cannot improve.
>
> ### Design loop (experimental)
>
> > Build a local shopping-list CLI. Run two design cycles, beginning with the smallest working proof of concept.
>
> [Design loop](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/orchflows/tree/main/example-workflows/design-loop) composes eight reusable workflows around a project endgoal: brainstorm and research, design one increment, implement it, independently compare it with the accepted baseline, then analyze the evidence for the next cycle. Its README includes a detailed flowchart and the component contracts.
>
> **Experimental — this packaged example is untested so far.** A full cycle uses six fresh children, with at most 6N calls for N attempted cycles. Trial specifications are included for future validation.
>
> ### Self-improve
>
> > /orch-self-improve Review this session and improve the workflows and guidance behind the problems you find.
>
> [orch-self-improve](skills/orch-self-improve/SKILL.md) learns from native agent history. Scope it to a session, period or project; by default it uses the current session. It checks whether an observed problem still exists in the current source or environment, then makes the smallest useful correction to local setup, custom workflows, guidance or Orchflows itself.
