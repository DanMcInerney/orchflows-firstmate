"""Pacing seam: one route's declared ceiling, waited out per route.

A measured ceiling is a constraint this package waits out, never one it works
around: there is no proxy pool, no address rotation, no second identity, and
no substituted route anywhere in it. The one lever :class:`RateGovernor` has
is time.

**Serialized per origin, concurrent across origins.** A ``fused`` run hands
this governor reads from several lanes at once (see :func:`runner.run_scheduled`),
and the governor is what keeps that safe: every read takes its origin's lock
before it waits, sends, or charges, so no origin ever sees two of this
package's reads in flight, and two origins never wait on each other. The lock
is the host's, not the route's, because an origin's ceiling is per host —
Reddit's shreddit partials and its RSS feed share one lock. Pacing uses the
route's declared budget; RSS feed and search share its measured origin bucket,
while the open route is metered per host. This module holds the locks; the pool that
hands it concurrent reads is the runner's.

Reliability bar: nothing here reaches the network or the filesystem. The
carrier is injected, the clock is injected, and both have offline stand-ins.
