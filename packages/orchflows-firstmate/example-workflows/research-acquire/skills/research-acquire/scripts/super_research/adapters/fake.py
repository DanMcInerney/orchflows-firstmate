"""Offline adapter: deterministic fixture pages, never live evidence.

``fake`` stands in for a route the roster has not implemented yet, and it
is the only adapter whose declaration comes from its payload rather than
from its own descriptor: a fixture page states which platform, identity
namespace, and representation it speaks for. Its route resolves to a
``fixture://`` origin, which the default opener refuses, so this adapter
cannot reach the network even by mistake.
