"""K0 GitHub reads, anonymous, under the tightest hourly ceiling in the roster.

Measured: `api.github.com`
answered anonymously, `api.github.com/search/repositories` answered 200 with no
credential, and `api.github.com/rate_limit` reported the anonymous ceiling as
**60/hr for core and 60/hr for code_search** — two buckets, measured apart. Two
buckets are two routes here, each with its own declared budget, so a search
never spends a repository read's hour.

**This is the one origin in the roster with a large, well-known write
surface, and none of it is reachable.** Not because no test tries it, but
because the set of operations this module can perform is enumerated: four,
listed in ``OPERATION_SURFACES``, each a GET on one of the two declared read
routes. There is no other path from :func:`fetch_native_page` to the carrier,
this module names no HTTP verb at all — the verb is the route's — and
``transport.admitted_methods`` returns reads and nothing else for both routes,
so a hand-built POST is refused in the opener before a socket exists. The
gate admits POST for exactly two named routes with no GET form; neither of
these is one.

**A 403 here is never ``auth_required``.** GitHub answers an anonymous client
that has spent its hour with 403 and a message about rate limits, and waiting
fixes that where a credential need not. Reporting it as a missing credential
would record the roster's tightest budget as a capability this package does not
have, which is the false claim the measured access ladder exists to prevent. So
every refusal here is the status it is, and the warning names what GitHub
documents the status as.

Pagination is the caller's: GitHub states how many repositories matched and
never how many pages it split them into, so no next page is derived from a
total and a row count. A caller that wants page two says so.
