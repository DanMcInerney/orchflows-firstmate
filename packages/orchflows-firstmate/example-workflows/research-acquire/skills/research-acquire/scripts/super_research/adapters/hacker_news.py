"""K0 Hacker News over three surfaces: Algolia for search and for a whole tree, Firebase for one item.

Measured:
``hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date`` answered 200 with full-text HN search,
``hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=comment`` answered 200 for comment search,
and ``hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/<id>`` answered 200 with ``by``,
``descendants`` and the ``kids`` tree. Reading Algolia beside Firebase is what
makes HN searchable at all: a Firebase-only adapter could list and hydrate
and never search.

Measured: ``hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/<id>`` answered 200 in
0.94 s with 135 KB — one story and its whole comment tree, 259 nodes, each a
``{id, created_at, created_at_i, type, author, title, url, text, points,
parent_id, story_id, children, options}`` object nesting its own children.
``points`` was an integer on the story and ``null`` on every comment; a
comment id answered 200 with the subtree under that comment; an id the index
holds nothing under answered 404 with ``{"error":"Not Found","status":404}``.
The same day ``search_by_date?query=spacex`` answered 20 hits with
``hitsPerPage: 20`` and no size asked for, and adding
``numericFilters=created_at_i>=<epoch>,created_at_i<=<epoch>&hitsPerPage=20``
answered 200 with hits inside the bounds — which is how a caller's window
travels to this index in the index's own terms.

**Two origins, three routes, and still one call each.** A search is one call to
Algolia's search endpoint, an item is one call to Firebase, and a tree is one
call to Algolia's items endpoint; no call here is ever two of them — this
module holds one descriptor per surface and spends exactly one of them per
call. Walking a Firebase ``kids`` list is one call per item with the core
choosing the next one, because an adapter that walked it would turn one bounded
call into a crawl whose size nobody declared. The tree surface is the same
bound met differently: the origin itself answers the whole tree in one payload,
so flattening what one call returned is reading, not crawling, and this module
still makes no second call to fill anything in.

**A comment never carries the story's points.** The tree states ``points`` on
every node and states ``null`` on every comment, and that null is left absent:
a comment record carries no engagement rather than its root's, which is the one
way a per-comment ranking could be quietly wrong on every row.

**An absence is not a shape change, in either direction.** Firebase answers a
request for an item it does not have with 200 and the body ``null``, and
Algolia answers a query nothing matched with 200 and an empty ``hits`` list.
Both are the origin saying there is nothing there, so both are `empty` and say
so out loud; only a payload that no longer carries the container this module
declares is ``schema_drift``. Typing an absence as drift sends a reader hunting
a shape change over an ordinary answer, and typing drift as an absence reports
the platform as quiet while this package reads the wrong keys.

**Neither surface has an ``auth_required`` branch, deliberately.** Both are
documented keyless, so no status either returns is a statement that a
credential was needed: a refusal here is the origin declining this read, and it
is recorded as the status it is.
