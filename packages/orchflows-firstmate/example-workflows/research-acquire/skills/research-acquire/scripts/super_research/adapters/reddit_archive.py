"""K3 Reddit hydration through the Arctic Shift archive.

Measured: Reddit's own ``.json``
surfaces return 403 to every User-Agent tried, and its RSS ceiling is one
to two requests per thirty seconds. Arctic Shift answered six back-to-back
requests at ~0.25 s with no throttle, returning ``score``,
``num_comments`` and ``created_utc`` — the native engagement the platform
itself will not serve keylessly.

It is an independent volunteer-run archive, so every record it produces
carries ``third_party_archive`` loss and names its operator: this is not
the platform speaking.
