"""Adapter protocol: one bounded request in, exactly one NativePage out.

Every adapter module exposes exactly two public names: ``DESCRIPTOR`` and
``fetch_native_page(carrier, request)``. An adapter parses one response
and stops. It never paginates, retries, falls back, calls another adapter,
or persists anything — the core owns the cap and the stop, and a cursor an
adapter finds is surfaced through ``cursor_out`` for the core to decide on.

**The core spends one.** ``runner.planned_calls`` is still the only place a
manifest becomes an ``AdapterRequest`` and still sets no ``cursor``; the
continuation is ``runner.run_step``'s, built from the page it has just read. A
discovery step therefore reads the page its ``cursor_out`` names, and the page
that one names, to ``runner.MAX_PAGES_PER_STEP``, with ``max_items`` bounding
the whole step rather than one page of it. The runner owns continuation and
concurrency; an adapter only reports the cursor an origin returned.

It also never makes the call itself: :func:`fetch_one_page` does, so the
channel verdict is read in one place for every adapter there will ever be.
