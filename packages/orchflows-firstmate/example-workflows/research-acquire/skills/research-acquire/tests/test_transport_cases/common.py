"""Transport suite: a local network block is never a platform response.

Every test here runs offline. The distinction this module defends is
the captive-portal caveat's: this host sits behind an appliance that answers some
domains with a failure status and a captive-portal body, and a route blocked
that way is UNVERIFIED, never rejected. Confusing that with a platform
response would record a local block as a platform gap.

It is defended twice, because classifying correctly and recording correctly
are different claims: at the transport seam, where the channel verdict is
made, and at the adapter and artifact seams, where it is what a caller keeps.
