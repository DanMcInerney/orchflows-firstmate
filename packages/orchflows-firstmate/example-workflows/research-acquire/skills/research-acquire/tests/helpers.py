"""Shared test scaffolding: one fake clock, one offline carrier, two guards.

Nothing here is a test, and no suite is required to use it. It exists because
a rate budget cannot be proven by waiting: a route measured at one request per
thirty seconds would cost a suite thirty real seconds per read, so the only
honest proof advances a clock instead.

``FakeClock`` is the load-bearing part. One object drives three things at once
— the monotonic seconds a cache reads, the monotonic seconds a governor paces
on, and the ISO stamp a transport writes onto a response — so a moment
fabricated anywhere is visibly different from the moment the origin was really
read, and a wait is a number rather than a delay.
