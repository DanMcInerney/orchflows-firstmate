    """How long each of the four answers may stand in for a fresh read.

    A TTL belongs to a route's own volatility, and `cache.py`'s default is
    deliberately short — a route nobody has measured is not one to trust for
    long. So every window declared here is proven from both sides: a re-read
    inside it that the inherited default would have sent back to the origin,
    and one outside it that goes back.

    The GitHub pair is the one where the argument is not only volatility.
    The 2026-08-10 probes recorded the anonymous ceiling at 60/hr per bucket — the
    tightest in the roster after Reddit's feed — so a repeat read there costs a
    minute of the hour rather than a second of latency, and that is a different
    kind of expensive from the 2.9 s Instagram profile.
