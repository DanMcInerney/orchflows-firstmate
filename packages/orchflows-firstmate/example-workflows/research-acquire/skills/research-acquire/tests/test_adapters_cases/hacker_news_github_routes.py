    Two adapters, four surfaces: HN publishes its search through Algolia and its
    item tree through Firebase, and GitHub spends its anonymous hour as two
    buckets — `core` and `code_search` — which `api.github.com/rate_limit`
    reported separately. Each bucket is a route because each is paced on its
    own, and `/repos/<owner>/<repo>` and `/search/<index>` do not share a path
    shape besides.

    The sharpest claim in this file is here rather than in an adapter: GitHub is
    the one origin in the roster with a large, well-known write surface, and
    nothing about that surface is reachable from this package. T07 widened the
    verb gate by one closed set for a route that has no GET form; all four of
    these are outside that widening, declare no body, and are refused every
    verb that is not a read.
