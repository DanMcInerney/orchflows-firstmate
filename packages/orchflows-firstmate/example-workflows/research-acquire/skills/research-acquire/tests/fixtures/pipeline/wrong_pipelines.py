"""Governors and fused paths that are wrong, each in exactly one way.

This file is not part of the package. Nothing imports it, no discovery pattern
matches it, and ``tests/test_pipeline.py`` loads it by path. It exists so the
oracles there can be shown to reject a wrong result without mutating the tree
under test: every governor below is the real one with a single method
overridden, and every fused path below runs the real one and then spoils
exactly one property of its output.

Each is a plausible mistake rather than an absurd one. A governor that never
waits is what "make the suite faster" looks like; a governor that stamps a
served answer with the moment it served it is what "keep the timestamps
current" looks like; a fused path that folds a hit into the target it found is
what "fused should not emit the same thing twice" looks like. All three would
pass a suite that only counted records.
