"""Adapters beside the tree: three ways a run could turn out to want a key.

Each is Reddit's own feed with one property of its answer spoiled, so a
rejection is attributable to that one difference and nothing under test was
mutated to produce it.

`environment_reading` is the one the keyless claim actually turns on. It reads
a token out of the environment and refuses without one — which is what eight
of the prior spec's eleven adapters were said to do. Run with the variable
exported it answers perfectly, and run with the environment emptied it
refuses; that difference is the whole reason the suite empties the environment
instead of sampling it. A keyless run that passed on a laptop with the key set
would have proven nothing, and this file is what makes that statement testable
rather than rhetorical.

Nothing in the package imports this file and no discovery pattern matches it.
