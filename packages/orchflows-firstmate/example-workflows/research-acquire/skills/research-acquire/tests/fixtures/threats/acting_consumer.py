"""Two consumers of one acquired artifact, written beside the tree.

Nothing in the package imports them and no discovery pattern matches them.
They exist so the T09 oracle can be shown to reject a caller that treats
acquired text as instructions, without mutating the tree under test.

The package's own position is that a record is data. A record's body is text
some origin sent, and the whole of "untrusted_content" is that no part of the
run — the plan, the grants, the write set — is allowed to be a function of it.
`acts_on_instructions` is what it looks like when something is: it reads the
same artifact everything else reads, finds the imperative the snippet carries,
and does what it says.
