"""Fused lanes: overlap across origins, one read at a time per origin.

`test_pipeline` proves the accounting of a run on a fake clock and one lane.
This suite proves the other half of what `fused` now means, and it needs a
real clock to do it: an opener that blocks lets two lanes on two origins be
caught inside their reads at the same moment, and an opener that sleeps lets
two lanes on one origin be shown never to be. Both proofs are made on the
recorded intervals of the reads themselves, so a governor that stopped taking
its origin lock, or a runner that stopped overlapping lanes, fails here rather
than at the first live run.

Nothing here reaches a socket: every opener is offline, and every fixture
route is the `fake` adapter's or a real adapter's with a canned answer.
