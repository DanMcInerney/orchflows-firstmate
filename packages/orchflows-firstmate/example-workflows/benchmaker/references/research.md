# Research lessons

Use these precedents to choose an approach, then inspect primary sources relevant to the actual target. These notes derive from the caller-supplied September 16, 2026 [design report](../DESIGN.md); they are not a new reproduction or independent validation. The similarly named BenchMaker research project is separate from this workflow.

| Decision | Precedent and lesson |
| --- | --- |
| Task and outcome validity | [Agentic Benchmark Checklist, v5](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.02825v5): audit both; high/low target scores alone validate neither |
| Cost and generalization | [AI Agents That Matter, v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.01502v1): report quality with cost and align holdouts with the scope claimed |
| Generated cases | [LLM-Powered Benchmark Factory, v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.01683v1): verify correctness, diversity and difficulty; multiple-choice generation is not a general agent interface |
| Coverage and dimensions | [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/): use scenarios and multiple metrics, not one score mixing unrelated abilities |
| Small subsets | [tinyBenchmarks, v2](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.14992v2): calibrated selection uses historical responses; an invented handful has no equivalent guarantee |
| Model judging | [Judging LLM-as-a-Judge, v4](https://arxiv.org/html/2306.05685v4): account for position, verbosity and self-enhancement bias |
| Uncertainty | [Dror et al., ACL 2018](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1128/): analysis depends on metric and observation/sampling assumptions |

Useful implementation boundaries: [Inspect](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tasks.html) separates tasks, solvers and scorers; [HAL](https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/about) preserves complete agent conditions and cost/performance comparisons; [Harbor](https://docs.harborframework.com/core-concepts/tasks/overview) separates instructions, environment, solution and verifier. Reuse a suitable existing harness without imposing its infrastructure on every task.

For domain design, inspect [AppWorld](https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/appworld) for state and collateral-change evaluation, [TravelPlanner](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/TravelPlanner) for resource-grounded constraints, [τ-bench](https://github.com/sierra-research/tau-bench) for complete interactive episodes, and [DeepResearch Bench](https://github.com/Ayanami0730/deep_research_bench) for distinguishing report quality from citation support. A small local fixture may borrow the boundary without claiming to reproduce the full benchmark.

The historical Orchflows benchmaker and local bench-stack informed the design. Neither is a runtime dependency or ready-made acceptance suite. Retain native execution, controls and explicit gaps; do not inherit the old ticket machinery, global concurrency assumptions, or its caller-specific 30–50% pass target. Optional adapters must preserve upstream execution/scoring meaning and demonstrate outcome parity before claiming integration.
