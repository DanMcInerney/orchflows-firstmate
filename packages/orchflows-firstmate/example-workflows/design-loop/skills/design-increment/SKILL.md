description: Turn a project goal, options and research into one scoped implementable increment and an old-versus-new evaluation plan.

Use the [shared handoff contract](../../references/design-loop-contract.md). Inputs are request context, baseline, options and research evidence, plus any prior observations; equivalent caller-supplied material is sufficient. Uses 1 fresh child.

Invoke core `orch-work` for the named assignment `design-increment` with these inputs and resolved Make guidance. Ask it to select one coherent increment, explain the decision and rejected alternatives, and specify changed behavior, boundaries, implementation outline, risks and required dependencies. The first cycle must target a minimum working PoC from the actual baseline.

Return a design that an implementer can follow and an evaluation plan fixed before implementation: acceptance criteria, baseline behaviors to preserve, shared inputs/harness and conditions, expected old-state deficits, improvement measures and required versus optional checks. Mark any unresolved question that blocks implementation. If no change is justified, return that conclusion and its evidence for analysis rather than fabricate scope.
