description: Implement one approved-scope design in an isolated candidate and return its exact reproducible state.
disable-model-invocation: true
---

Use the [shared handoff contract](../../references/design-loop-contract.md). Inputs are request context, identified immutable baseline, design and evaluation plan, and an isolated writable candidate derived from that baseline. A caller invoking this leaf alone supplies or establishes those states before delegation. Uses 1 fresh child.

Invoke core `orch-work` for the named assignment `implement-increment` with the inputs, candidate workspace and resolved Make guidance. Ask it to implement the design within scope and report actual progress or blockers. Normal implementation checks and fixes stay within this assignment; they do not replace independent comparison testing or alter its acceptance criteria.

Return changed artifact paths, run/use instructions, known limitations and actual implementation check results. Freeze and identify the resulting candidate for the next handoff; the baseline stays unchanged. A partial implementation remains a candidate with explicit gaps.
